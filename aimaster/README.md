## nn		:: Always updated to the Latest Neural Network Features of aimaster.

### Current Features of nn::

- Model Class with Initialization and multiple activations available.
- Neural Network *visualization*.
- Could specify Activation ("**relu**", "**sigmoid**" or "**tanh**").
- Sigmoid has regularization(L1) implemented in it along with
an experimental boost feature(always use a value less than 0.1 for boost)
- Live training with visualization.
- Visualization is now a subprocess. Implementation with pipe (plots every iteration, hence a little slowüòÅ) or Queue (Plots when the subprocess could while Main process will keep running very fast) are available.Visualization with Queue is default and is as fast as without visualization.
- Saving and Loading Models. (Using pickle)

## tools ::  
 contains aimaster's tools like visualization functions.

### nnrelu ::  
 Nerural Network with relu activation only.(Except for output layer {sigmoid})  

### nnsigmoid ::  
 Neural Network with sigmoid activation only.  

### nntanh ::  
 Neural Network with tanh activation only.

**nn1hlnb** Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer and No Bias.  
**nn1hlib** Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer with input Bias.  
**nn1hlhb** Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer with hidden layer Bias.  
**nn1hlfb:** Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer with full bias(both input and Hidden layer Bias).  
**nn2hlfb:** Neural Network with '2' Hidden Layer with full bias.  
**nnfb:** Neural Network with adjustable architecture full biased.



## Sample
```python
from aimaster.nn import model
yourmodelname = model(["your desired architecture"]
```
For Example ```model([4,5,5,3])``` gives a 
neural network with 4 inputs plus a bias neuron and two hidden layers of 5 neurons each and with bias and an output layer of 3 neurons.
