### nn		:: Neural Network with adjustable architecture full biased.  
Architecture of the Neural network can be specified by

```python
nn.createnn(["your desired architecture"]) 
```
Example ```nn.createnn([4,5,5,3])``` gives a 
neural network with 4 inputs plus a bias neuron and two hidden layers of 5 neurons each and
with bias and an output layer of 3 neurons.


### nn1hlnb ::  
 Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer and No Bias.  
### nn1hlib ::  
 Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer with input Bias.  
### nn1hlhb ::  
 Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer with hidden layer Bias.  
### nn1hlfb ::  
 Neural Network with '1' Hidden Layer with full bias(both input and Hidden layer Bias).  
### nn2hlfb::  
 Neural Network with '2' Hidden Layer with full bias.  
  
### tools ::  
 contains aimaster's tools like visualization functions.
