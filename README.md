aimaster
========

Artificial Neural Network learning and experimentation tools with live visualization.  
(NOTE: Donot use pipe visualization with very large networks ðŸ˜….)  
  
This module needs `numpy` and `scipy` installed.
And `matplotlib` for visualization.

Feel free to experiment with aimaster.  

## Installation

Use `pip install aimaster` or `pip3 install aimaster` to install package from PyPI.  

## Running example code

Run `example.py` from file system or
From interactive terminal
`from aimaster import example`
`example.run()`

The example is a NN model learning a basic XOR gate with visualization in action.
